NAME
    Crypt::ZCert - Manage ZeroMQ4+ ZCert CURVE certificates

SYNOPSIS
      use Crypt::ZCert;

      my $zcert = Crypt::ZCert->new(
        public_file => "/foo/mycert",
        # Optionally specify a secret file;
        # defaults to "${public_file}_secret":
        secret_file => "/foo/sekrit",
      );

      # Loaded from existing 'secret_file' if present,
      # generated via libzmq's zmq_curve_keypair(3) if not:
      my $pubkey = $zcert->public_key;
      my $seckey = $zcert->secret_key;

      # ... or as the original Z85:
      my $pub_z85 = $zcert->public_key_z85;
      my $sec_z85 = $zcert->secret_key_z85;

      # Commit any freshly generated keys to disk
      # (as '/foo/mycert', '/foo/mycert_secret')
      # Without 'adjust_permissions => 0', _secret becomes chmod 0600:
      $zcert->commit;

      # Retrieve a key pair (no on-disk certificate):
      my $keypair = Crypt::ZCert->new->generate_keypair;
      my $pub_z85 = $keypair->public;
      my $sec_z85 = $keypair->secret;

DESCRIPTION
    A module for managing ZeroMQ "ZCert" certificates and calling
    zmq_curve_keypair(3) from libzmq <http://www.zeromq.org> to generate
    CURVE keys.

  ZCerts
    ZCert files are "ZPL" format (see Text::ZPL) with two subsections,
    "curve" and "metadata". The "curve" section specifies "public-key" and
    "secret-key" names whose values are "Z85"-encoded (see Convert::Z85
    CURVE keys.

    On disk, the certificate is stored as two files; a "public_file"
    (containing only the public key) and a "secret_file" (containing both
    keys).

    Also see: <http://czmq.zeromq.org/manual:zcert>

  ATTRIBUTES
   public_file
    The path to the public ZCert.

    Coerced to a Path::Tiny.

    Predicate: "has_public_file"

   secret_file
    The path to the secret ZCert; defaults to appending '_secret' to
    "public_file".

    Coerced to a Path::Tiny.

    Predicate: "has_secret_file"

   adjust_permissions
    If boolean true, "chmod" will be used to attempt to set the
    "secret_file"'s permissions to 0600 after writing.

   public_key
    The public key, as a 32-bit binary string.

    If none is specified at construction-time and no "secret_file" exists, a
    new key pair is generated via zmq_curve_keypair(3) and "secret_key" is
    set appropriately.

   secret_key
    The secret key, as a 32-bit binary string.

    If none is specified at construction-time and no "secret_file" exists, a
    new key pair is generated via zmq_curve_keypair(3) and "public_key" is
    set appropriately.

   public_key_z85
    The "public_key", as a "Z85"-encoded ASCII string (see Convert::Z85).

   secret_key_z85
    The "secret_key", as a "Z85"-encoded ASCII string (see Convert::Z85).

   metadata
      # Get value:
      my $foo = $zcert->metadata->get('foo');

      # Iterate over metadata:
      my $iter = $zcert->metadata->iter;
      while ( my ($key, $val) = $iter->() ) {
        print "$key -> $val\n";
      }

      # Update metadata & write to disk:
      $zcert->metadata->set(foo => 'bar');
      $zcert->commit;

    The certificate metadata, as a List::Objects::WithUtils::Hash.

    If the object is constructed from an existing "public_file" /
    "secret_file", metadata key/value pairs in the loaded file will override
    key/value pairs set in the object's "metadata" hash.

   zmq_soname
    The "libzmq" dynamic library name; by default, the newest available
    library is chosen.

  METHODS
   generate_keypair
    Generate and return a new key pair via zmq_curve_keypair(3); the current
    ZCert object remains unchanged.

    The returned key pair is a struct-like object with two accessors, public
    and secret:

      my $keypair = $zcert->generate_keypair;
      my $pub_z85 = $keypair->public;
      my $sec_z85 = $keypair->secret;

   commit
    Write "public_file" and "secret_file" to disk.
